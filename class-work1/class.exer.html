            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating
            pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a
            complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of
            the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
            happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because
            it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue

            pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances
            occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To
